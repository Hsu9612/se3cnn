To better reproduce the experiments of the article *3D Steerable CNNs: Learning Rotationally Equivariant Features in Volumetric Data* go to [this commit](https://github.com/mariogeiger/se3cnn/tree/546bc682887e1cb5e16b484c158c05f03377e4e9)



# New code
For point cloud I recommand to use this code:
[https://github.com/e3nn/e3nn](https://github.com/e3nn/e3nn)

For voxel I don't know which one is better
